This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

### A very brief introduction
- The S language was developed at AT&T Bell labs by Rick Becker, John Chambers and Allan Wilks, starting as early as in the 1970s.
- It was commercialized as S-PLUS.
- `R` is the open-source implementation of S. (google ``R programming language, wikipedia'' to read more).
- From `R` FAQs: "Why is `R` named `R`?:

    "The name is partly based on the (first) names of the first two     `R` authors (Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka), and partly a        play on the name of the Bell Labs language `S'."

- (IMPORTANT!!) `R` is case-sensitive.

### Getting help when using `R`
-  The official R website CRAN <https://cran.r-project.org> has a number of manuals online.
-  You can find help using the following `R` commands. 
-  `help(sort)`--using exact command names and this command needs to be loaded already. same as `\sf ?sort`.
-  `apropos(``sor'')`--part of a command name.
-  `help.search(``sort'')`--search the description of commands.
-  `example(sort)`--show you example usage of a command.
-  `RSiteSearch(``sort'')`--search for online available help.

### Data in `R`
-  In `R`, data and functions are called `R` objects.
-  Variables are stored as vectors in `R`.
-  A data set is usually in the form of a matrix, array or data frame.
-  Data frame can be made from vectors of the same length.
-  A list is a vector of `R` data objects.
-  Value assignment using `<-` or `=`.

### Basic opertaions
First let's load some data. Type `data()` in the `Console` window will open a list of all the datasets that were included with the standard installation. 

`R` uses basic syntax for simple arithmetics. In the following, the gray blocks are `R` codes you can tyep into the `console` window to try them out. The white blaocks are outputs. 

```{r}
2+3
3^2
4/2
log(10)
sin(pi/3)
```

You can create a variable as a vector of data values, with each element representing the value from an individual. $X=[X_1, \ldots, X_n]$. `length()` gives you the number of entries (i.e., the sample size). `mean()` calculates the sample average of the values. Similarly, we have other founctions that compute simple statistics such as `median`, `var`, `quantile`. `table` summarizes the counts of occurances corresponding to unique values of `x`. 
```{r}
x=c(3, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 5, 1,4)
length(x)
mean(x)
table(x)
```

### Load a R data set

Now let's load a data set that comes with standard `R` installation: `InsectSprays`.

You can read about the documentation of this data set by typing `help(InsectSprays)` in the Console window. 

```{r}
data(InsectSprays)
dim(InsectSprays)
```

- The function `dim` tells us the dimension of this data set. It is a $72 \times 2$ matrix, with each row being an experiment (individual) and each column being a variable (counts of insects, types of insecticide).

- In this example, we refer to different columns of the data set by names of the column `InsectSprays[, "count"]`. We can also refer to the columns by number, `InsectSprays[,1]`.

You can summarize the values of the variable `spray` (types of insecticide) using `table` and make a pie chart using the function `pie`.
```{r}
table(InsectSprays[,"spray"])
pie(table(InsectSprays[,"spray"]))
```

You can summarize the values of the variable `count` (count of insects) using `summary` and visualize using `hist`.
```{r}
summary(InsectSprays[,"count"])
hist(InsectSprays[,"count"], xlab="Insect Counts", main="")
```
